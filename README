Audio equalizers are important tools for adjusting the gains of various
frequencies in an audio sample so that the sound output is more desirable.
Typically, they are used to help offset unique differences in the frequency
responses of speakers in order to more accurately replicate the original sound
that was recorded. This report describes the design and implementation of a
parametric equalizer, a device that an important additional benefit over
conventional equalizers: it allows the user to construct an audio filter of
nearly any shape.
